                <p>
                    I'm an engineer with a track record of launching and building startups that look at thoughtful product and user experience. I am deeply entrenched in the startup landscape, particularly through my work at NDRC, from making investment decisions to supporting and creating dealflow and helping guide startups from ideation through to investment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My technical background allows me to marry the core of a company's product with a larger strategic vision. My own startup experience in Mirr and VC Hunt underscores my ability to identify and build products that have a meaningful impact on users and fit an identifiable market need.
